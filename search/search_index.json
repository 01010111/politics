He pivoted his influencer focus from red pill misogyny to pro-Russian talking points shortly before the large scale Russian invasion in 2022. in 2023 he was arrested under Ukrainian law - Article 436-2, titled \"Justification, recognition as legitimate, denial of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, glorification of its participants\". He was released on bail and placed on house arrest. Later that year he was arrested while attempting to flee Ukraine to Hungary. Five months later he died while in custody of pneumonia.</p> <p>While I'm focused on debunking a myriad of disinformation Lira shared on his social media accounts, I do want to make some personal beliefs clear - while disinformation may be vile, I don't believe that people should be imprisoned for it. Wartime disinformation can be catastrophic, but I believe speech should not be punished by the state with imprisonment. I also believe that the wellbeing of prisoners is the responsibility of the state. While death from pneumonia is common in prisons around the world - including in the United States - the state ought to have a larger focus on prisoner welfare. </p> <p>My intention in debunking Lira is not to smear his name posthumously, but rather to correct information that continue to spreads after the influencer's death.

Trying to be thorough, I read in a report from Ukraine's Anticorruption Action Centre that Zlochevsky had sold a controlling interest in Burisma to Kolomoisky's Privat Group (source). This connection did have me taking a second look at Lira's accusations, but the more I read, the more the facts lined up to disprove his theories - Zelensky's links to Kolomoisky went from \"finger puppet\" to a few meetings, some financial support, and ultimately a Zelensky administration that punishes Kolomoisky over and over. Hunter Biden's links to Kolomoisky went from a \"spiritual cousin\" to Zelensky because of Kolomoisky bankrolling Biden (including kickbacks to Joe Biden) to owning shares in a company employing Hunter Biden, while Joe Biden's administration investigates and punishes Kolomoisky, and the company with controlling shares being privatized two years into Hunter's five year tenure on the board of directors.</p> <p>If Kolomoisky was bankrolling Hunter Biden (Joe Biden by proxy) - why would the FBI investigate Kolomoisky?

His rhetoric and policies around immigration highlight this unseriousness - perhaps more so than his cartoonish mannerisms, his ceaseless and desperate need for approval, or his clownish spray tan.</p> <p>I'm non partisan on immigration. My beliefs on it are a pastiche of my former libertarian ideals, my childish notions of American exceptionalism, and a practical desire for the wellbeing of everyone - elements of my identity that regularly clash with my more liberal or even leftist tendencies. To put it more clearly, and to put it in words with which I believe most people would generally agree:</p> <ul> <li>America should maximize freedoms</li> <li>America has a tradition of being a safe-haven</li> <li>America should strive to be good</li> </ul> <p>If we get more into the weeds of things, we might find more disagreement. To show my more conservative beliefs on immigration, I also believe:</p> <ul> <li>Something may have to be done about our asylum process</li> <li>People who abuse our asylum process should be denied asylum</li> </ul> <p>I'm also not an expert on immigration. I believe it's a fairly big problem to solve - how do you in good faith protect the American tradition of being a welcoming safe-haven while curbing a process that has real world costs? I could try to bloviate half baked ideas, talk about caps or hiring judges, but instead I'll just reveal what I believe the process should be before even attempting to offer a solution:</p> <ul> <li>Determine what the issue is</li> <li>Determine the cost of the issue</li> </ul> <p>It feels like in modern American politics, statements like \"People who abuse our asylum process should be denied asylum\" or \"Determine what the issue is\" are packed with so much baggage that an interlocutor might assume \"denying asylum\" would be equivalent to heartless and brutal deportation, and that a desire to \"determine what the issue is\" is equivalent to putting one's head in the sand.</p> <p>I am not a policy maker, I make video games. If there is a problem, I would like it to be addressed. If someone comes to America hoping for a better life, and they've abused our asylum process to do so, I would like them to be treated with humane understanding. In my naive utopian fantasies, citizenship would be a quick and painless process and dealing with immigrants who abuse one path to America could gently be guided to the the correct path to America. I do not know the systems well enough to levy blame on border patrol, or NGOs, or politicians seeking new systems to address the issue - much less immigrants seeking better lives.</p> <p>I understand the conservative views on immigration, because I listen to them - people in my family, people online, people with prominent voices in conservative media - all echoing things said by Trump:</p> <p>And you have many, many of these people are\u00a0criminals. This could be 12 million people a year. That's a big percentage of the people in our country...</p> <p>...who would think that somebody would want open borders where people flood in by the millions from all over the world from prisons and from mental...</p> <p>That starts with stopping the pouring into our country of millions and millions of illegal immigrants, which are causing a new category of violence...</p> <p>sources</p> <p>So let me get in front of this. If 12 million prisoners were rampaging across the country causing unchecked violence, it would be a national emergency. However, even saying that sounds like I'm hyperbolizing Trump's statements in bad faith. Instead let's cover individual points:</p> <ul> <li>12 million illegal immigrants enter the US every year</li> <li>Biden has an \"open borders\" policy on immigration</li> </ul> <p>My first reaction to this claim is \"12 million?\" (I think the first time I heard the claim it was 8 million, I assume in another few years it could be 20 million!) And when I try to put a finger on that figure I come up with a loss. It's easy to find numbers like 1.5 million, but anything significantly over that seems unreasonable - until you know where Republicans get that number. It could be that they're quoting the total number of unauthorized immigrants in the US - a number that has fluctuated around 12 million since the mid 2000s. Of course, if Trump was quoting this figure, he'd be framing it in such an incorrect way that it would make him unfit to work the drive thru register at McDonalds, much less nuclear codes and the free world. (To be clear, I think the typical drive-thru operator at McDonalds is intelligent, kind, and underpaid - we should hold our politicians to a higher standard than these workers, but I regularly see rage directed at them for missing a special request while we allow multitudes of incompetence at our highest seats of power!)</p> <p>Related: Trump Parades delusional Immigration chart at RNC</p> <p>It's more likely that Trump is inflating numbers from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's statistics on Border Encounters. This raises alarm bells for me on Trump's second claim - that Biden's policy on immigration is to leave the border wide open.</p> <p>This claim would be like hearing that the U.S. Forest Service responds to thousands of wildfires a year and to conclude that the policy of the U.S. Forest Service is to ignore fires because there are thousands of wildfires a year. It's stupid on its face, and doesn't even get to the crux of the issue - is it a problem that there are thousands of wildfires a year? What is causing the wildfires? Can we prevent wildfires while addressing the natural cycle of dry brush catching fire and releasing decaying carbon into the environment? Does climate change have an effect on the frequency of wildfires?</p> <p>My fear with Trump's second term is that he seems completely disinterested in observing this issue, asking meaningful questions, or forming coherent policy around it - and he's joined by his administration, his followers, and the cowering sycophants in the Republican Party.

People who push the replacement theory (Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, Elise Stefanik, Newt Gingrich, Robert F Kennedy Jr, and countless other alt-right politicians and pundits) are stupid, liars, or both. Like many other conspiracy theories, great replacement is a confluence of many disparate conspiracy theories that coalesce into one larger movement. For example, COVID theories are as diversified as \"COVID was a bioweapon meant to target whites\" to \"Science elites lied about the efficacy of the vaccines\", the former being completely unhinged, and the latter arguably being true (by cherry picking a handful of statements from a much, much wider pool of statements) - the point is that these conspiracy theorists will throw 500 different things against the wall, and if just one or two things stick (not factually of course, but memetically), it validates the entire movement or - more insidiously - leaves the orbit of the movement so the ideas and goals of the movement don't get tainted by the movement itself. I just wanted to write down all of the realities that these conservatives currently hold in their heads. I'll pair these beliefs with actual facts to show that - like Trump - the ideas around immigration pushed by replacement theorists are incongruous not only with reality, but also with themselves.</p> <ul> <li>MAGA belief: Democrats are shipping illegal immigrants into red states to create a wider voter base in red states to flip them blue - something Trump's future U.N. ambassador and great replacement theory supporter Elise Stefanik calls \"election insurrection\"</li> <li> <p>Reality: Along with the fact that illegal immigrants cannot vote in federal elections, the 2024 election showed a drastic uptick of Latino support for Trump, raising from 35% in 2020 to 46% in 2024, including 55% of Latino men supporting Trump (source)</p> </li> <li> <p>MAGA belief: Democrats are shipping illegal immigrants into blue states to pad census data so blue states will be appointed more seats in Congress.</p> </li> <li>Bonus MAGA belief: It's actually very funny and good for conservative Governors to ship illegal immigrants into blue states - including Texas MAGA Governor Greg Abbot, who has spent nearly $150 million shipping over 100,000 immigrants to different left leaning cities around the country (source)</li> <li>Reality: Immigrants often settle in red states, and when the census was administered in 2020, red states gained three congressional seats, and blue states lost three congressional seats (source). If unauthorized immigrants were excluded from the apportionment count, blue states would lose three seats, while red states would lose four (source) .</li> </ul>","tags":["trump","immigration","maga","great-replacement","rfk-jr","elise-stefanik","newt-gingrich","tucker-carlson"]},{"location":"Domestic%20Politics/MAGA%20Believe%20Community%20Notes%20are%20Compromised/","title":"MAGA Believe Community Notes are Compromised","text":"","tags":["maga","twitter","jimmy-dore"]},{"location":"Domestic%20Politics/MAGA%20Believe%20Community%20Notes%20are%20Compromised/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>When MAGA tweets get community notes, instead of confronting ideas that may run contrary to their beliefs, they instead claim that twitter's community notes feature has been compromised by bots, paid actors, or the feds.

What I am seeing is a direct attempt to silence, censor, de-prioritise, de-monetise, isolate &amp; cast doubt against anyone that questions the current plans of Governments, Big Pharmaceutical &amp; The Parasitic ruling classes. Enterprising Desert Raven, is the user name for a single Community Notes Contributor. Since joining Community Notes in March 2023 it has posted nearly 5000 community notes. A Bot? A Group of paid agenda activists? Or 3 Letter agencies? One thing is for sure, in my opinion, it\u2019s impossible to be a single person. It is posting over 70 Community Notes per day, every day. Without rest. These notes have to be backed up with linked supporting evidence. It is just not possible to achieve this on a daily basis This is a relentless attack on anyone that dares to questions the things that have happened to us, or the plans they have in place for humanity. Community Notes works on a basis that when a Contributor sees a post and wishes to correct that post. They create a Note that provides information and links to data that support their note. When enough Contributors approve the Note, it goes live. If Contributors don\u2019t agree with the note, they state why and can add counter information, it\u2019s then not published, but left pending unless other contributors then agree with the original Note, then it goes live. Attached is a video all of the Community Notes that Desert Raven has added, both published and pending in just the last 10 days. This is from within the CN section so you will not normally get to see this. The vast majority of these notes are in pending waiting to go live. The video goes on forever! It\u2019s only the last 10 days worth. Impossible for a single user to create. There is no doubt you will know someone in this video that they have attempted to censor. You will notice the recurring themes. Desert Raven protects the Jabs, Big Pharma, Current Government Regimes, Climate Change &amp; the WEF. Anyone that questions what\u2019s going on, that has a large follower base appears to be targeted, especially Blue Ticks. The Community Notes that have been approved, all appear to be supported by the same group of contributors. This is really bad and extremely concerning. I will individually contact every single person that has had an attempt to de-popularise their posts in this video. @elonmusk You urgently need to do a complete audit of community notes, especially targeting the most active contributors. They are either bots, or groups of bad actors working together to utilise a single account and push an agenda. IP and Mac Address access would easily identify this.

But in 2018, two infants died after receiving the measles vaccine. The country quickly placed its vaccine program on hold, as vaccine opponents, including Children\u2019s Health Defense, exploited theses deaths to raise questions about the safety of vaccines. The vaccination rate plummeted from in the 60-to-70 percent range to 31 percent. But the problem, it turned out, was not with the vaccine. Two nurses had mistakenly mixed the vaccine with a muscle relaxant. Once this was revealed, CHD did not update social media posts suggesting the vaccine was the culprit. (Those posts are no longer available.)</p> <p>During the stretch in which the vaccination coverage was dropping in Samoa, Kennedy visited the nation in June 2019 and gave a boost to anti-vaxxers there who had used the death of those two infants to help cause the drop in vaccination rates. He had a meeting with Taylor Winterstein, a prominent Samoan Australian vaccination foe. In an Instagram post featuring a photo of her with Kennedy, Winterstein wrote, \u201cI am deeply honoured to have been in the presence of a man I believe is, can and will change the course of history. This was a divinely timed, once in a lifetime opportunity and I will forever cherish the conversations and moments we shared together in Samoa.\u201d She added hashtags used by anti-vaxxers. Public health experts complained Kennedy\u2019s visit to Samoa helped amplifly anti-vax voices.</p>","tags":["trump","rfk-jr","anti-vax","maga"]},{"location":"Domestic%20Politics/Trump%20Parades%20delusional%20Immigration%20chart%20at%20RNC/","title":"Trump Parades delusional Immigration chart at RNC","text":"","tags":["maga","trump","immigration"]},{"location":"Domestic%20Politics/Trump%20Parades%20delusional%20Immigration%20chart%20at%20RNC/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Trump plasters chart on immigration onto 9 different screens at the RNC that shows immigration trends - an arrow labelled \"TRUMP LEAVES OFFICE\" and the data spiking directly after.

You see, Zelensky - the president of Ukraine - well - the coke head of Kiev - because he is a coke head - the coke head of Kiev is actually a manufactured political figure. He was manufactured by a Ukrainian-Israeli-Cypriote oligarch called Ihor Kolomoyskyi. Now Ihor Kolomoyskyi was the man who owns 1+1 Media here in Ukraine, and 1+1 Media is the company that financed and produced the TV show \"Servant of the People\". \"Servant of the People\" hired Zelensky - a well known actor in Ukraine - an actor with zero political experience, or even any political interest - well - they hired him to play the role of the president in the show \"Servant of the People\". Now, \"Servant of the People\" had huge ratings but a lot of people said that it was really weird the amount of propaganda and PR that was done for the show. It was disproportionate to any other show of any channel, the amount of PR, positive press and all the rest of it. It was really pushed on the people. Some people said it was completely astro-turfed. Some people who know how to speak Ukrainian and who have watched this show have told me that \"it's a mildly enjoyable show, but no big deal\", but anyway...The show was hugely popular, and it ran from 2015 to 2018, and almost seamlessly, Kolomoyskyi - the oligarch - created a party called \"Servant of the People\" - same name as the TV show. And their candidate was Zelensky, a man with no previous political experience and indeed no previous political interest, and Kolomoyskyi financed Zelensky to the point that Zelensky today is a billionaire - how many actors do you know that are billionaires, hm? I mean I don't think that Tom Cruise is a billionaire and he's the most successful actor in the world. If he's just an actor... Zelensky is more than just an actor, hm. He's the finger-puppet of Kolomoyskyi - this oligarch, and do you know who Kolomoyskyi also financed to the tune of $50,000 a month - plus additional benefits of different sorts? Hunter Biden. Yes. In 2014, Burisma - the Ukrainian oil company...gas company, excuse me - hired Hunter Biden to be on its board of directors to the tune of \\(50,000 a month. Who do you think controls Burisma? Kolomoyskyi - the same guy who manufactured Zelensky as president of Ukraine. Yep. Bet you didn't know that, hm? Zelensky and Hunter Biden are spiritual cousins, they are bankrolled by the same guy. It's funny because both of them have, uh, drug addictions - pretty serious ones, hm? Both of them get their money from Kolomoyskyi, and both of them are intimately involved in Ukraine. But here's the difference of course - Zelensky doesn't have a dad who's President of the United States, now does he? Why do you think the White House, the United States is freaking out so badly over Ukraine, hm? In Ukraine, there are all kinds of secrets. In Ukraine, well, see, the more unsavory people in the Washington establishment have used Ukraine as their private piggy bank, to the detriment of the Ukrainian people. They have financially raped Ukraine, stripping it of moneys and assets - moneys and assets needed by the people of Ukraine. And this is part of the reason that Ukraine is one of the poorest countries in Europe if not the poorest country in Europe - because of corruption, because of how Westerners have exploited it - Western politicians have exploited it. Hunter Biden...\\)50,000 a month, and you say to yourself, \"well $50,000 is not much\", well yeah $50,000 a year is the median household income in the United States. In Ukraine - a much poorer country - $50,000 a year would easily uh, solve the problems of a good 4 or 5 families in Ukraine - the financial problems of those 4 or 5 families in Ukraine for a year. And Hunter Biden was getting that money per month - just for himself! Although of course in the Hunter Biden emails there's talk that seems to be true that \"The old man\" would get a 10% kickback of whatever Hunter Biden was getting, hm? That was in the uh, laptop, oh yeah. Look it up! You don't have to take my word for it, you don't have to take my word for any of what I'm telling you, hm? Look it up yourself, and you'll find it, it's very easy to find. Kolomoyskyi - the Ukrainian-Israeli-Cypriote oligarch - was financing Zelensky, was financing Joe Biden, God else, God alone knows who else he was financing, and he was just one, there's a whole rotten bunch of these people, here in Ukraine, and they're all busy paying off the West so that they could carry on their little evil deeds and whatnot, hm? If you want to know why the West was freaking out over Ukraine, you have to understand that they are all terrified that the truth will come out in Ukraine. The biolabs that just came out? Victoria Newland - the under secretary of state - admitted that these biolabs existed in Ukraine. Why do you think that she would admit to such a thing if it weren't true? And she said that they were uh, instructing the people in Ukraine on how to dispose of all their material before the Russians could get their hands on it. Now that's weird. I mean, if I'm a biolab, and I'm working on the cure for Alzheimer's or something like that, I'm not worried about the Russians getting their hands on my research - on the contrary I'm worried that the Russians might come in and destroy it - maybe on purpose, maybe on accident, right? But that's my worry, I'm not thinking to myself \"Oh the Russians are coming therefore I'm going to proactively destroy my research.\" I'd never think that if I'm working on something, uh, mundane or potentially beneficial to the human race. But I would be thinking that if I'm working on something really nasty. If I'm working on something really nasty like a super anthrax virus or something like that. Or some super plague that will kill off a whole bunch of people. Then I'd be thinking to myself - how do I get rid of this material - this research that I've done - before the Russians find it and get it and get their hands on it and show the world what I've been up to. See, that's the thing that all the politicians in the West are worried about in so far as Ukraine is concerned. They don't really care about Russia taking over, they don't care about the Ukrainian people, they don't care if Ukraine is turned to rubble, actually they hope it will, because in that rubble will be hidden all their deeds, their evil deeds, their corrupt deeds - that's why they want to destroy Ukraine, that's why they don't care how many Ukrainian civilians die needlessly in this conflict. They want Ukraine to be turned to rubble so that in the rubble will be hidden all the evil corrupt things that they have done. Understand this. </p>"}]}
