## Immigration

Donald Trump is a deeply unserious person thrust into a position where his unseriousness will cause very serious problems. His rhetoric and policies around immigration highlight this unseriousness - perhaps more so than his cartoonish mannerisms, his ceaseless and desperate need for approval, or his clownish spray tan.

I'm non partisan on immigration. My beliefs on it are a pastiche of my former libertarian ideals, my childish notions of American exceptionalism, and a practical desire for the wellbeing of everyone - elements of my identity that regularly clash with my more liberal or even leftist tendencies. To put it more clearly, and to put it in words with which I believe most people would generally agree:

- America should strive to be good
- America has a tradition of being a safe-haven

If we get more into the weeds of things, we might find more disagreement. To show my more conservative beliefs on immigration, I also believe:

- Something may have to be done about our asylum process
- People who abuse our asylum process should be denied asylum

I'm also not an expert on immigration. I believe it's a fairly big problem to solve - how do you in good faith protect the American tradition of being a welcoming safe-haven while curbing a process that has real world costs? I could try to bloviate half baked ideas, talk about caps or hiring judges, but instead I'll just reveal what I believe the process should be before even attempting to offer a solution:

- Determine _what_ the issue is
- Determine the cost of the issue

It feels like in modern American politics, statements like "People who abuse our asylum process should be denied asylum" or "Determine what the issue is" are packed with so much baggage that an interlocutor might assume "denying asylum" would be equivalent to heartless and brutal deportation, and that a desire to "determine what the issue is" is equivalent to putting one's head in the sand.

I am not a policy maker, I make video games. If there is a problem, I would like it to be addressed. If someone comes to America hoping for a better life, and they've abused our asylum process to do so, I would like them to be treated with humane understanding. In my naive utopian fantasies, citizenship would be a quick and painless process and dealing with immigrants who abuse one path to America could gently be guided to the the correct path to America. I do not know the systems well enough to levy blame on border patrol, or NGOs, politicians seeking new systems to address the issue - much less immigrants seeking better lives.

I understand the conservative views on immigration, because I listen to them - people in my family, people online, people with prominent voices in conservative media - all echoing things said by Trump:

>And you have many, many of these people areÂ criminals. This could be 12 million people a year. That's a big percentage of the people in our country...

>...who would think that somebody would want open borders where people flood in by the millions from all over the world from prisons and from mental...

>That starts with stopping the pouring into our country of millions and millions of illegal immigrants, which are causing a new category of violence...

So let me get in front of this. If 12 million prisoners were rampaging across the country causing unchecked violence, it would be a national emergency. However, even saying that sounds like I'm hyperbolizing Trump's statements in bad faith. Instead let's cover individual points:

- 12 million illegal immigrants enter the US every year
- Biden has an "open borders" policy on immigration

My first reaction to this claim is "12 million?" (I think the first time I heard the claim it was 8 million, I assume in another few years it could be 20 million!) And when I try to put a finger on that figure I come up with a loss. It's easy to find numbers like [1.5 million](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/27/u-s-immigrant-population-in-2023-saw-largest-increase-in-more-than-20-years/#:~:text=These%20immigrants%20hail%20from%20many,2.1%20million%2C%20or%204%25), but anything significantly over that seems unreasonable - until you know where Republicans get that number. It could be that they're quoting the [total number](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/) of unauthorized immigrants in the US - a number that has fluctuated around 12 million since the mid 2000s. Of course, if Trump was quoting this figure, he'd be framing it in such an incorrect way that it would make him unfit to work the drive thru register at McDonalds, much less nuclear codes and the free world.

It's more likely that Trump is inflating numbers from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's statistics on [Border Encounters](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-land-border-encounters). This raises alarm bells for me on Trump's second claim - that Biden's policy on immigration is to leave the border wide open.

This claim would be like hearing that the U.S. Forest Service responds to thousands of wildfires a year and to conclude that the policy of the U.S. Forest Service is to ignore fires because there are thousands of wildfires a year. It's stupid on its face, and doesn't even get to the crux of the issue - is it a problem that there are thousands of wildfires a year? What is causing the wildfires? Can we prevent wildfires while addressing the natural cycle of dry brush catching fire and releasing decaying carbon into the environment? Does climate change have an effect on the frequency of wildfires?

My fear with Trump's second term is that he seems completely disinterested in observing this issue, asking meaningful questions, or forming coherent policy around it - and he's joined by his administration, his followers, and the cowering sycophants in the Republican Party. Instead there seems to be a joy in their pearl-clutching ignorance - a coddled catharsis because someone is finally giving validation to the night terrors instead of telling him that the nightmare is just in their heads.
