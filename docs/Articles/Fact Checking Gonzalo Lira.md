# Background

Gonzalo "Coach Red Pill" Lira was a Chilean-American social media influencer who lived in Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He pivoted his influencer focus from red pill misogyny to pro-Russian talking points shortly before the large scale Russian invasion in 2022. in 2023 he was arrested under Ukrainian law - Article 436-2, titled "Justification, recognition as legitimate, denial of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, glorification of its participants". He was released on bail and placed on house arrest. Later that year he was arrested while attempting to flee Ukraine to Hungary. Five months later he died while in custody of pneumonia.

While I'm focused on debunking a myriad of disinformation Lira shared on his social media accounts, I do want to make some personal beliefs clear - while disinformation may be vile, I don't believe that people should be imprisoned for it. Wartime disinformation can be catastrophic, but I believe speech should not be punished by the state with imprisonment. I also believe that the wellbeing of prisoners is the responsibility of the state. While death from pneumonia is common in prisons around the world - including in the United States - the state ought to have a larger focus on prisoner welfare.

#### Kolomoyskyi financed and produced "Servant of the People"

> Now Ihor Kolomoyskyi was the man who owns 1+1 Media here in Ukraine, and 1+1 Media is the company that financed and produced the TV show "Servant of the People".

1+1 Media was the channel that had rights to air "Servant of the People", Zelensky's own Kvartal 95 production agency produced the series.

#### Kolomoyskyi created the Servant of the People Party

> Kolomoyskyi - the oligarch - created a party called "Servant of the People"

The Servant of the People Party is a successor to the Party of Decisive Change, founded in 2016 by Eugene Yurdiga, and again, Zelensky's Kvartal 95 was the force behind the rebranding of the party, not 1+1 Media or Kolomoyskyi.

#### Kolomoyskyi controls Burisma

> Who do you think controls Burisma? Kolomoyskyi - the same guy who manufactured Zelensky as president of Ukraine. Yep. Bet you didn't know that, hm?

Burisma was founded by its current president Mykola Zlochevsky, Kolomoyskyi is not linked to Burisma.
