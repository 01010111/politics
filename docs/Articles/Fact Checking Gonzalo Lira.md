## Background

Gonzalo "Coach Red Pill" Lira was a Chilean-American social media influencer who lived in Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He pivoted his influencer focus from red pill misogyny to pro-Russian talking points shortly before the large scale Russian invasion in 2022. in 2023 he was arrested under Ukrainian law - Article 436-2, titled "Justification, recognition as legitimate, denial of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, glorification of its participants". He was released on bail and placed on house arrest. Later that year he was arrested while attempting to flee Ukraine to Hungary. Five months later he died while in custody of pneumonia.

While I'm focused on debunking a myriad of disinformation Lira shared on his social media accounts, I do want to make some personal beliefs clear - while disinformation may be vile, I don't believe that people should be imprisoned for it. Wartime disinformation can be catastrophic, but I believe speech should not be punished by the state with imprisonment. I also believe that the wellbeing of prisoners is the responsibility of the state. While death from pneumonia is common in prisons around the world - including in the United States - the state ought to have a larger focus on prisoner welfare. 

My intention in debunking Lira is not to smear his name posthumously, but rather to correct information that continue to spreads after the influencer's death. Whether by accident or by design, Lira's positioning of himself as a pro-Russian influencer in 2022 made him a catalyst of popular pro-Russian propaganda and misinformation.

#### Zelensky is a coke head

>You see, Zelensky - the president of Ukraine - well - the coke head of Kiev - because he is a coke head - the coke head of Kiev is actually a manufactured political figure.

Stories of Zelensky admitting to using cocaine being deepfakes, digitally altered:

#### Kolomoisky financed and produced "Servant of the People"

> Now Ihor Kolomoisky was the man who owns 1+1 Media here in Ukraine, and 1+1 Media is the company that financed and produced the TV show "Servant of the People".

1+1 Media was the channel that had rights to air "Servant of the People", Zelensky's own Kvartal 95 production agency produced the series.

#### Kolomoisky created the Servant of the People Party

> Kolomoisky - the oligarch - created a party called "Servant of the People"

The Servant of the People Party is a successor to the Party of Decisive Change, founded in 2016 by Eugene Yurdiga, and again, Zelensky's Kvartal 95 was the force behind the rebranding of the party, not 1+1 Media or Kolomoisky.

#### Zelensky is a billionaire

> Zelensky today is a billionaire

According to Forbes, Zelensky's net worth is closer to $20 million, two orders of magnitude off from claims that he is a billionaire.

#### Destroying Super Anthrax at secret US-funded bio-weapon labs

>I would be thinking that if I'm working on something really nasty. If I'm working on something really nasty like a super anthrax virus or something like that. Or some super plague that will kill off a whole bunch of people. Then I'd be thinking to myself - how do I get rid of this material - this research that I've done - before the Russians find it and get it and get their hands on it and show the world what I've been up to.

After the Russian invasion into Ukraine in 2022, there was a torrent of Ukrainian biolab memes originating from Russian propaganda, ranging from claims that the US was helping Ukraine develop [bioweapons that target ethnic Russians](https://tass.com/world/1419965) to claims like Lira's - that provoked by a potential Russian invasion of Kiev, these secret biolabs were found destroying materials to either cover up their "evil deeds", or to prevent Russia from using the bioweapons against them. These claims are so scatter-shot with no clear origin or source that it's virtually impossible to tackle them all, but I've spent time looking into it in the past, going so far as to debunk a popularly-shared video "showing" Ukrainian biolabs destroying their work - [Twitter disinfo - Ukraine biolab burning documents - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV7oG_PpBhE)

### Worth Noting

In 2016, Kolomoisky's PrivatBank was nationalized by the Ukrainian government, this was challenged in 2019, but the legality was affirmed in 2022.

In 2019, the FBI investigated Kolomoisky and conspirators, leading to allegations from the DOJ in 2020, and being banned from the US in 2021.

In 2020, Zelensky's administration sponsored an "anti-Kolomoisky" law that prevented private recovery of nationalized assets.

Later in 2022, Kolomoisky's Ukrainian citizenship was revoked, two of his oil companies were seized by Ukraine Security Services (SBU).

In 2023 Kolomoisky was arrested by the SBU for money laundering and fraud, prompting Zelensky to address law enforcement, saying "no more decades-long 'business as usual' for those who plundered Ukraine and put themselves above the law and any rules."

### In summation

Conspiracy theorists like Gonzalo Lira depend on obfuscation and omission of facts to make convincing accusations. Even I can read into a topic and become suspicious of someone like Kolomoisky - while researching this I was initially surprised to see that Kolomoisky was not the oligarch that founded and ran Burisma - it was another oligarch named Zlochevsky. Trying to be thorough, I read in a report from Ukraine's Anticorruption Action Centre that Zlochevsky had sold a controlling interest in Burisma to Kolomoisky's Privat Group ([source](https://archive.ph/20140811211522/http://antac.org.ua/en/2012/08/kings-of-ukrainian-gas/)). This connection did have me taking a second look at Lira's accusations, but the more I read, the more the facts lined up to disprove his theories - Zelensky's links to Kolomoisky went from "finger puppet" to a few meetings, some financial support, and ultimately a Zelensky administration that punishes Kolomoisky over and over. Hunter Biden's links to Kolomoisky went from a "spiritual cousin" to Zelensky because of Kolomoisky bankrolling Biden (including kickbacks to Joe Biden) to owning shares in a company employing Hunter Biden, while Joe Biden's administration investigates and punishes Kolomoisky, and the company with controlling shares being privatized two years into Hunter's five year tenure on the board of directors.

If Kolomoisky was bankrolling Hunter Biden (Joe Biden by proxy) - why would the FBI investigate Kolomoisky? Why would the DOJ subject Kolomoisky's assets to civil forfeiture? Joe Biden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken even said:

>While this designation is based on acts during his time in office, I also want to express concern about Kolomoisky’s current and ongoing efforts to undermine Ukraine’s democratic processes and institutions, which pose a serious threat to its future.

If Zelensky was Kolomoisky's "finger puppet" - why would Zelensky's administration pass "anti-Kolomoisky" laws regarding nationalized assets? Why would Zelensky's administration strip Kolomoisky of his passport? Why would Zelensky's administration arrest Kolomoisky for corruption?

While some of these events happened after Lira's video - and indeed after his death - most of these facts were available to him? Why would he be so sloppy in describing the relationships between Hunter Biden, Zelensky, and Kolomoisky?
