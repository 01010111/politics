### Ben Shapiro

[Ben Shapiro: Donald Trump Is A Liar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX5dBzxKNOw)

>...he tells it just like it is...except he doesn't - because as entertaining as Donald Trump is - Donald Trump is a liar...Trump's three biggest crowds are evangelicals,  conservatives, and "he's a winner" voters. Trump is lying to all of them. Stop buying the lies.

### Matt Walsh

[Let Me Make This Perfectly Clear: I Will Never Vote For Donald Trump](https://archive.ph/2020.06.22-164906/https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/let-me-make-this-perfectly-clear-i-will-never-vote-for-donald-trump#selection-1137.0-1137.383)

>I have spent months calling Trump what he is: a conman, a tyrant, a pathological liar, a flamboyant despot, a fraudster, a big government liberal, progressive in a very poorly fitting and unconvincing conservative costume, a Planned Parenthood apologist, an unrepentant philanderer, a crook, a creep, a fascist with a spray tan, a reality TV Mussolini, a Caligula with bad hair, etc.

[If We Lived In A Truly Christian Nation, Donald Trump Would Not Be Winning](https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/if-we-lived-in-a-truly-christian-nation-donald-trump-would-not-be-winning)

>...America is falling into the grip of a grotesque megalomaniac, pathological liar, clinical narcissist, and unrepentant strip club owner who talks openly about his desire to date his own daughter...

[Trump Fans, If Hillary Becomes President You'll Only Have Yourselves To Blame](https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/trump-fans-if-hillary-becomes-president-youll-only-have-yourselves-to-blame)

>I won't vote for Trump because he's a vindictive, self-obsessed, pathological liar who has not demonstrated the competency to run a campaign, let alone a country.
>
>I won't vote for Trump because he lacks the moral fortitude to take a stand on any issue, the wisdom to understand the issues and the sincerity to care about any of them in the first place...
>
>...I won't vote for Trump because he's a scam artist under investigation for financial fraud.
>
>I won't vote for Trump because he has promised to squash dissent and punish those who criticize him.
>
>I won't vote for Trump because, on top of all of this professional and political weaknesses, he's a serial adulterer who abandoned two wives and couldn't be troubled to raise his own kids. I could almost forgive his numerous failed business ventures, but if a man fails in business, _and_ fails as a father and a husband, _and_ writes books bragging of his betrayals, _and_ insists he does not need forgiveness for anything, that tells me he is utterly bankrupt and morally destitute to his core.
### JD Vance

[Trump-Endorsed Candidate JD Vance Once Said Trump Might Be ‘America’s Hitler’](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jd-vance-trump-messages/)

>I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn’t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he’s America’s Hitler. How’s that for discouraging?

[Charlie Rose Interviews JD Vance](https://charlierose.com/videos/29349)

>I’m a ‘Never Trump’ guy...I never liked him.

### Tucker Carlson

[5 Times Tucker Carlson Privately Reviled Trump: ‘I Hate Him’](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/business/media/tucker-carlson-trump.html)

>We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights...I truly can't wait. I hate him passionately.

>What he's good at is destroying things. He's the undisputed world champion of that.

>Trump's a demonic force, a destroyer.
### Mitch McConnell

[McConnell called Trump 'stupid,' 'despicable' in private, according to new book](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/mcconnell-called-trump-stupid-despicable-private-after-2020-114884151)

>They’ve had just enough of the misrepresentations, the outright lies almost on a daily basis, and they fired him...And for a narcissist like him, that's been really hard to take, and so his behavior since the election has been even worse, by far, than it was before, because he has no filter now at all...[Trump is] stupid as well as being ill-tempered and can’t even figure out where his own best interests lie.

>This despicable human being, is sitting on this package of relief that the American people desperately need.

### Mike Johnson

[Johnson Said in 2015 Trump Was Unfit and Could Be ‘Dangerous’ as President](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/us/politics/mike-johnson-donald-trump.html)

>The thing about Donald Trump is that he lacks the character and the moral center we desperately need again in the White House...I am afraid he would break more things than he fixes. He is a hot head by nature, and that is a dangerous trait to have in a Commander in Chief.

>What bothered me most was watching the face of my exceptional 10 yr old son, Jack, at one point when he looked over at me with a sort of confused disappointment, as the leader of all polls boasted about calling a woman a ‘fat pig.’
