### Summary
Anti-vaxxers might claim legitimacy for an "International Covid Summit III" at European Parliament, where several figures espoused anti-vax talking points such as the dangers of the Covid vaccines, how Dr. Fauci planned the pandemic, and more.

In fact, the event was not as prestigious as they pretend. It was an unofficial event hosted by a handful of EU Parliament members of the small European Conservatives and Reformists Group, who rented out a room in the building to host Robert F. Kennedy Jr's anti-vax non-profit - Children's Health Defense.

**Quick facts:**
- This was the first summit hosted by the parliamentary members and Children's Health Defense, despite it having the "III" title, in an attempt to make it seem more legitimate.
- This event was held at a rented room at European Parliament to make it seem more legitimate, but even the EU Parliament website holds no record of the event taking place.
- Despite the EU Parliament credentials, only 5 of the over 700 EU parliament members attended - the five being the hosts of the event.
- One speaker - Dr. David Martin (not a medical doctor) - participated in the 2020 film "Plandemic: Indoctrination"
- Another speaker - Stephen Malthouse - is a former family practitioner who was suspended from practicing for spreading misinformation about COVID and selling fake vaccine exemption certificates.
- Nick Hudson, another anti-vax speaker at the event, has direct business interests in alternative medicines called "nutraceuticals" for treating COVID through his company Brenn-O-Kem.
