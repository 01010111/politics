### Summary
Trump plasters chart on immigration onto 9 different screens at the RNC that shows immigration trends - an arrow labelled "TRUMP LEAVES OFFICE" and the data spiking directly after. The problem for Trump is that the arrow is pointing towards the beginning of 2020, and he actually left office well after the trend spikes back up. Trump, as well as whoever made the chart, is either incapable of reading simple numbers, or is lying so brazenly that you have to wonder who could possibly buy into it.
