In the aftermath of hurricane Helene, Trump supporters spread misinformation about FEMA - that FEMA is refusing to give aid, and that relief packages are actually loan packages. In reality the $750 immediate assistance given out by FEMA does not need to be repaid, and other assistance from FEMA should only be repaid in the event that the recipient's insurance covers the damage. FEMA responds to this misinformation - [FEMA.gov](https://www.fema.gov/node/fema-will-only-provide-750-disaster-survivors-support-their-recovery)

>ðŸš¨BREAKING: Hurricane victims are now realizing that the $750 from FEMA that Kamala Harris is offering them is actually a loan, not real relief. And that if they donâ€™t pay it back the feds can seize their property. These people donâ€™t even have property anymore because of the hurricane.

>ðŸš¨BREAKING: Whistle blowers in FEMA confirm that Kamala Harris has ordered them to stand down and do nothing and even withhold financial aid while hurricane victims in North Carolina and Georgia are dying. Kamala Harris is murdering innocent American citizens.
